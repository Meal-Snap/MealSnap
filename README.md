## Overview
### Description

Our social media app is aimed for foodies or food lovers (same idea ðŸ˜†)!
We aim to create a platform where foodies can post their recipes and also a caption along with an image of their foods. 
Users will be able to search via the search field to find foods to try out or check out as well as like the posts and hopefully comment.
Users will also be prompted upon account creation to select their food preferences (as we plan to) to then have their feed show other usersâ€™s foods that align to their taste.
We wanted to separate the food out of all social media and have it in one social platform so that itâ€™s easier to find posts on just food! :3

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile. Functionality would be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Shows food posts to other users. Users can post their food pics as well as recipes and a description about their food post. Users can also like other posts as well as hopefully comment and grow their food choices outside of what they know.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be required to add allergy warnings.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on what they want to cook, whether it be Japanese or Mediterranean, Vegan, or perhaps dietary preferences...etc.
- **Scope:** First users should mark their dietary preferences. Then we could try to show them results of other posts that match their dietary preferences. They can eventually search other food types in the search bar.

- Here the profile page and settings page are not implemented yet.
- The recipe view controllers and uploads are not updated yet.

### Unit 11 GIF
- In addition to Unit 10's accomplishment, users can now see the feedview more neatly as a proper grid with 3 per row.
- Users can also view their profiles with their username 
- Users can as well see the recipes associated to all the posts which are one to one unique relationship as well as the users who uploaded the post.

### Unit 12 GIF

- Users can now like the posts on the PostViewController.

### Unit 13 GIF
- We have finished the unlike function, where the user taps the filled heart and it unfills it. It is confirmed through with testing our Parse backend. At this point we are finished and have a MVP!
