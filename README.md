## Overview
### Description

Our social media app is aimed for foodies or food lovers (same idea ðŸ˜†)!
We aim to create a platform where foodies can post their recipes and also a caption along with an image of their foods. 
Users will be able to search via the search field to find foods to try out or check out as well as like the posts and hopefully comment.
Users will also be prompted upon account creation to select their food preferences (as we plan to) to then have their feed show other usersâ€™s foods that align to their taste.
We wanted to separate the food out of all social media and have it in one social platform so that itâ€™s easier to find posts on just food! :3

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile. Functionality would be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Shows food posts to other users. Users can post their food pics as well as recipes and a description about their food post. Users can also like other posts as well as hopefully comment and grow their food choices outside of what they know.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be required to add allergy warnings.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on what they want to cook, whether it be Japanese or Mediterranean, Vegan, or perhaps dietary preferences...etc.
- **Scope:** First users should mark their dietary preferences. Then we could try to show them results of other posts that match their dietary preferences. They can eventually search other food types in the search bar.
